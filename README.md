"Vidya Intarweb Playlist" HTML5 Player

I wanted the ability to personally tweak the playlist contents so I wouldn't have to skip as often, and have the ability to add songs from different sources.

Mostly an exercise of rewriting jQuery calls into native JavaScript, and converting some XML data into JSON.

[First HTML5 Port of VIP](http://fpgaminer.github.io/vip-html5-player) - This is what I used for a while through college, which I used as a base of reference.

[Official VIP Player](http://vip.aersia.net/vip.swf) - This is the more recently created frontend by the original playlist creator.
