"Vidya Intarweb Playlist" HTML5 Player
======================================

[First HTML5 Port of VIP](http://fpgaminer.github.io/vip-html5-player) - This is what I listened to throughout college, using as inspiration / reference.

[Official VIP Player](http://vip.aersia.net/vip.swf) - This is the more recently created frontend by the playlist maker.
