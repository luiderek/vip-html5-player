"Vidya Intarweb Playlist" HTML5 Player
======================================

I wanted the ability to personally tweak the playlist contents of a webplayer that I enjoyed using as background music so I wouldn't have to skip as often, and have the option in the future to add songs from different sources if I wanted to.

Mostly an exercise of rewriting jQuery calls into native JavaScript, and reading and converting XML data into JSON. Was initially an attempt to replace functions and preserve code, but it ended up being easier to do a complete rewrite, keeping the overall program structure.

Songs are currently a subset of the "Mellow" playlist of the vidya interweb playlist, with less vocals and wind instruments.

This is what I used for a while through college, which I used as a base of reference.
